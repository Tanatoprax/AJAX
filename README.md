AJAX is a discord moderation bot that also has an EDSM and INARA API connection so you can use it for Elite: Dangerous servers.

> As this project is under heavy development, I cannot offer support at this time.  However, please do report bugs or issues on my little project [here.](https://github.com/Worthy-Alpaca/AJAX/issues)

**You can add AJAX to your server [here.](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=682255208125956128&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fworthyalpaca.de%2F&scope=bot)**

## What I can do

- I have build in spam protection and can be used to multi-kick. I also have the ability to add/remove roles to multiple members at once. Furthermore I feature a customizable rank system that allows users to show what they like to play/do.
- I have a database at my back that allows you to use your own admin, moderator etc. roles.
- Once you invite me to your server I will set up a bot-setup channel that can be used to configure me, using my built in !setserver command. Once all has been configured I will delete the channel after 2min. 
- In the configurtion you also have the option to set a custom prefix. My default prefix is **!**.

I feature three categories
> - fun
> - moderation
> - info
